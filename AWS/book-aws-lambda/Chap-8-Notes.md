# Chapter 8: Designing and authentication service

This Chapter was mainly an overview/architecture plan to build a server-less application using lambda, web browsers(client-side) javascript as well as implementation of a mobile app.

However, there were a few interesting things to note...
- This book mentions (p 151) That this could be achieved by using AWS gateway API, which would decouple the client-side with lambda, and instead hit the API directly, which would in-turn hit lambda.
  - Something to consider in the future development of apps.
