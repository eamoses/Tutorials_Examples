### Bootstrap-React-SPA
After diving into a bunch of aimless stuff with bootstrap/react/spa/.sh I realized I'm trying to do too much at once. Here's the plan of attack
- 1 - get basic template of JUST bootstrap working 	
  - `./basic-bootstrap-temp`
- 2 - get basic react/spa (A) running 		 	        
  - `./basic-react-spa-temp`
- 3 - read blog from (Link: E)					
- 4 - Combine 1&2 bootstrap-react-spa			          
  - `./basic-bootstrap-react-spa-temp`
- 5 - Build .sh file for **#2** & **#4**
  - `build-basic-react-spa-temp.sh` & `build-basic-bootstrap-react-spa-temp.sh`

### Finish AWS
Look, i really left this at a bad spot, It'd be great to at least finish chapter 11 with a bow. Meaning: I finish the .sh files for generating the aws stuff / notive code and it works!
